== HAProxy Template Router

The template router has two components:

* a wrapper that watches endpoints and routes and causes a HAProxy reload based on changes.
* a controller that builds the HAProxy configuration file based on routes and endpoints.

[NOTE]
====
The link:https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.5/configuration.html[HAProxy router] uses version 1.5.18.
====

The controller and HAProxy are housed inside a pod, which is managed by a deployment configuration. The process of setting up the router is automated
by the `oc adm router` command.

The controller watches the routes and endpoints for changes, as well as
HAProxy's health. When a change is detected, it builds a new haproxy-config file
and restarts  HAProxy. The haproxy-config file is constructed based on the
router's template file and  information from {product-title}.

The  HAProxy template file can be customized as
needed to support features that are not currently supported by {product-title}.
The link:https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.5/configuration.html[HAProxy
manual] describes all of the features supported by HAProxy.

The following diagram illustrates how data flows from the master through the
plug-in and finally into an HAProxy configuration:
